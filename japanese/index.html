    <h1>Small collection of Japanese analysis documents</h1>

This is a small collection of some simple analyses of Japanese that came about while learning the language and noticing or being frustrated by some peculiar aspect. There might not be too many, but I thought it would be nice to put it somewhere.

      Kanji semordnilaps Semordnilaps are words that form new words when read in reverse, like dog and god. They are called semordnilap, because it’s palindromes backwards. With kanji, this happens quite often. This list was generated using the JMdict database JMdict. Each entry contains the two spellings with readings and all...
